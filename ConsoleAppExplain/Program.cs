    //The Console class in C# provides functionality for interacting with the console window,
    //which is the text-based interface where input and output operations can be performed.
    //It allows you to read input from the user, write output to the console, and perform other console-related operations.
    //In the provided code, the Console.WriteLine method is used to write the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
    //This method writes the specified string followed by a line terminator to the console window.
    //The line terminator is a platform-specific character or characters that separate lines in the console output.
