    internal class Program//2,3
    {
        // Entry point of the program
        static void Main(string[] args)//4
        {

//Sure! Let's break down the code and explain each part:
//1.	namespace: A namespace is a way to organize and group related code together.
//It acts as a container for classes, interfaces, and other types.In this code,
//the namespace is TheMainMethod, which means that all the code within this file
//belongs to the TheMainMethod namespace.

//2.	internal: internal is an access modifier in C#.
//It specifies that the class or member can only be accessed within the same assembly (or project).
//In this code, the Program class is marked as internal, which means it can
//only be accessed within the ConsoleApp2 namespace or assembly.

//3.	class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects.It defines the properties,
//methods, and events that an object of that class will have.In this code,
//the Program class is defined, which serves as the entry point for the program.

//4.	static: The static keyword is used to declare a member(method or variable)
//that belongs to the class itself, rather than to instances of the class.
//In this code, the Main method is marked as static, which means it can be called
//without creating an instance of the Program class.

//5.	void: void is a keyword used to indicate that a method does not return a value.
//In this code, the Main method is declared as void, which means it does not return anything.

//6.	string[] args: This is the parameter list of the Main method.
//It specifies that the method takes an array of strings as input,
//which is commonly used to pass command-line arguments to the program.
//In this code, the Main method accepts an array of strings named args.

//To summarize, the code you selected represents the entry point of the program.
//It is a static method called Main that belongs to the Program class,
//which is defined within the ConsoleApp2 namespace.The Main method
//takes an array of strings as input and does not return any value.
